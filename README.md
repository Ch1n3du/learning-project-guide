# learning-project-guide
A repository containing information on how members are to approach project based learning 

Steps:

#A repo is created with a readme file describing the challenge to be completed, and containing links to more info/resources
#You fork the repo, and create a new folder/directory named in format "firstname-lastname"
#Add your code and PR whenever you want a review or are ready to merge.
#Each PR would need two reviews to be merged. 
ENSURE ALL YOUR contributions ARE WITHIN THIS FOLDER TO AVOID MERGE-CONFLICTS(Any contributions you want to make to the repo outside your folder must follow the issue-fork-branch flow used to make open source contributions)
